# wireframing

A wireframe is like a rough sketch of a website or app.
Think of it as the blueprint, it shows what goes where (like buttons, menus, or images) but doesn’t worry about colors, fonts, or fancy designs yet.Imagine planning a house,
You decide where the walls, doors, and windows will be,but you’re not picking the paint color or type of tile yet. That comes later.
Wireframes help everyone like designers, developers, and even non-tech folks to understand how the website will work before you build it.

They’re meant to be simple, so people can focus on what matters most:
 -How users move around
 -What information goes where
 -How the product works

*And because they’re simple, it’s easy to change things. This helps teams get feedback early and make better decisions before diving into full design or development.*

# Types of Wireframes

 There are two levels of wireframing;
 -low fidelity 
 -high fidelity 

 ## Low fidelity wireframing

 A low-fidelity wireframe is a very rough and simple sketch of a website or app layout.It’s like drawing your idea with a pen and paper,no fancy colors, no real pictures, just basic shapes to show where things should go (like buttons, text boxes, and menus).You can make low-fidelity wireframes on paper, but tools like Figma make it easier to share with your team and update quickly as your ideas change.
 

 ## High fidelity wireframing
 A high-fidelity wireframe is a detailed and polished version of your design idea.It builds on your basic sketch (low-fidelity) and makes it look more like the real thing.
Instead of just boxes and lines, high-fidelity wireframes include:Colors,Images and icons,Fonts and text, Real buttons and menus,Even little details like shadows and textures
This version is what you show when you want people to see how the final product might actually look and feel.It’s helpful for Showing your brand style,Testing how users react to the look and design and also Helps developers understand exactly what to build

# Key Elements of Wireframing
## Layout Structure
What it is: The basic arrangement of different sections on the screen (header, body, footer, sidebar, etc.).
Why it matters: It gives users a sense of organization and flow, helping them understand where to find what.

Example:
On an e-commerce homepage:

The top might have the logo and search bar.

The middle shows featured products.
























The bottom has links like Contact, FAQs, and Terms.
Think of it like the floor plan of a house.

 ## Navigation
What it is: Menus, tabs, or links that help users move around the site.

Why it matters: It lets users explore easily without getting lost.

Example:

A top navigation bar with links like: Home | Shop | About | Cart

A side menu for filtering clothes by size or category.

Good navigation makes the site user-friendly and fast to explore.

## Content Placement
What it is: Deciding where to put headings, text, images, videos, or buttons.

Why it matters: Helps make information clear, readable, and easy to find.

 Example:

-A blog post layout might have:

-A title at the top,
-Author info just below,
-large image under that,



Note:Good content placement draws attention to the most important parts first.

## Functionality
What it is: Interactive parts of the interface — like buttons, forms, sliders, dropdowns.

Why it matters: It shows how the user will interact with the site — not just what they’ll see.

Examples:

A search bar lets users type in a product name.

A “Buy Now” button takes them to checkout.

A form collects user info for a newsletter.
